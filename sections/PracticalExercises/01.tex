\subsubsection{Exercise 1}
Write a Matlab script that generates a gray-scale image f(x,y) as in problem 9.35 and use the appropriate gray-scale morphological image processing procedure to clean up the spikes.
\textbf{Problem 9.35}
A gray-scale image, $f(x,y)$, is corrupted by nonoverlapping noise spikes, that can be modeled as small, cylindrical artifacts of radii $R_{min}\leq r\leq R_{max}$ and amplitude $A_{min}\leq a \leq A_{max}$.\\
\textbf{Solution}
\begin{lstlisting}
I = imread('rice.png');
subplot(3,3,1);
imshow(I);

for x = 2:9
    S = strel('square',x);
    Iopen = imopen(I,S);
    subplot(3,3,x);
    imshow(Iopen,[]);
end
\end{lstlisting}
